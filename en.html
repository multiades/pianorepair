      <h3>My journey</h3>
      <p>
        Music has played a key role in my life for years, both because of my family and the loss of my vision during my childhood.
        I started playing the piano at the age of 8. I attended the music schools of Pallini and Alimos and then studied social work at the University of West Attica.
        At the same time, I built my technical background in piano tuning and maintenance, both in my grandfather's and Nikotian music house's workshops. 
        The knowledge and skills which I acquired culminated in the certification of piano tuning and maintenance by the

      <h3>Life in Greece</h3>
      <p>
        After coming to Greece in 1981, he excelled in the field of tuning, maintenance and restoration of all types of pianos. 
        The heartfelt references of his old clients and colleagues to his name even today constitute a solid proof for that fact.
